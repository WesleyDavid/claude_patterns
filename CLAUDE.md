# TOOLS

You have access to GitHub through the `gh` CLI as my GitHub user WesleyDavid. Use that first when attempting to interact with GitHub.
If you create any scripts within a folder, place them in a claude_scripts directory within that same folder.
If you create any temporary files, place them in a claude_temp_files directory within that folder.
Do not create helper scripts. If you must write edge case handling, or pre and post processing of any data, add all of that into a single script using classes, methods, functions or whatever paradigm is most idiomatic for the language that's being used.
