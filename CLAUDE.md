# TOOLS

You have access to GitHub through the `gh` CLI as my GitHub user WesleyDavid. Use that first when attempting to interact with GitHub.
If you create any scripts within a folder, place them in a claude_scripts directory within that same folder.
If you create any temporary files, place them in a claude_temp_files directory within that folder.
Do not create helper scripts. If you must write edge case handling, or pre and post processing of any data, add all of that into a single script using classes, methods, functions or whatever paradigm is most idiomatic for the language that's being used.

# FILE MANAGEMENT

Create and / or use the following files:

- TASKS.md
    - Use this file to keep track of past, current, and future tasks.
    - Be very detailed in your breakdown of larger goals into small actionable tasks.
- PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT.md
    - Include pivots to design as we move along.
    - This of this as justifying each change to a project as we move along towards the end goal.
- PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
    - This is the end goal as we currently see it.
    - This document may change as we go along, however always consider what is in this file as the gold standard of truth for what the end result should be.
    - Do not include pivots to the original design, or alterations to the design that occurred as new information and challenges were discovered. Save that information in @PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT.md
